# Prompt and Smell -- Ultrasonic Diffuser Dependencies
#
# Install with:  pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: Some packages are platform-specific. See comments below.

# --- GPIO Control (Raspberry Pi) ---
# Install ONE of these. gpiozero is recommended (higher-level API).
# These only work on Raspberry Pi. On other systems, the diffuser
# controller will automatically fall back to simulation mode.
gpiozero>=2.0,<3.0
# RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0  # Alternative: lower-level GPIO library

# --- Speech Recognition ---
SpeechRecognition>=3.10,<4.0

# PyAudio is required by SpeechRecognition for microphone access.
# Installation can be tricky on some platforms:
#   Raspberry Pi / Linux:  sudo apt install portaudio19-dev && pip install pyaudio
#   macOS:                 brew install portaudio && pip install pyaudio
#   Windows:               pip install pyaudio  (binary wheel usually available)
PyAudio>=0.2.13,<1.0

# --- Text-to-Speech ---
pyttsx3>=2.90,<3.0

# --- Anthropic Claude API ---
anthropic>=0.39.0,<1.0

# --- CLI Framework ---
click>=8.1,<9.0

# --- Rich Terminal Output ---
# Tables, progress bars, panels, colored text
rich>=13.0,<14.0

# --- Data Validation ---
pydantic>=2.0,<3.0

# --- Optional: Local Speech Recognition (Whisper) ---
# Uncomment the line below to enable offline speech recognition using
# OpenAI Whisper. This requires ~1-3GB of disk space for model weights
# and a reasonably powerful CPU (or GPU for faster inference).
# openai-whisper>=20231117

# --- Optional: NeoPixel LED Ring ---
# Uncomment if using a NeoPixel LED ring for visual status feedback.
# Only works on Raspberry Pi.
# rpi_ws281x>=5.0,<6.0
# adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel>=6.3,<7.0

# --- Optional: OLED Display ---
# Uncomment if using an SSD1306 OLED display for status readout.
# adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306>=2.12,<3.0
# Pillow>=10.0,<11.0

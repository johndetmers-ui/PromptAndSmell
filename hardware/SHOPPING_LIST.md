## Ingredients: Starter Palette (16 Items)

### Carriers and Diluents

These are not scent ingredients themselves -- they are the base solvents that carry and dilute the aroma chemicals.

| # | Ingredient | CAS Number | Category | Note Type | Typical Usage % | Approx. Price (30ml) | Recommended Supplier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Perfumer's Alcohol (SDA 40B or 190-proof ethanol) | 64-17-5 | Carrier | -- | 50-80% | $8-12 | Perfumer's Apprentice |
| 2 | Dipropylene Glycol (DPG) | 25265-71-8 | Diluent | -- | 20-60% | $5-8 | Creating Perfume |
| 3 | Isopropyl Myristate (IPM) | 110-27-0 | Carrier | -- | 10-40% | $6-10 | Amazon / Creating Perfume |

**Notes on carriers:**
- Perfumer's alcohol (SDA 40B) is denatured ethanol specifically for fragrance. If unavailable, 190-proof grain alcohol (Everclear) works but is more expensive. Some regions restrict high-proof alcohol sales.
- DPG is the most common diluent for evaluating aroma chemicals. Odorless, stable, non-volatile. Good for testing formulas on blotter strips.
- IPM is an alternative carrier with good skin compatibility, useful if you later want to make skin-safe fragrance oils.

### Top Notes

These are the first things you smell. They are volatile and evaporate within 15-60 minutes.

| # | Ingredient | CAS Number | Category | Note Type | Typical Usage % | Approx. Price (30ml) | Recommended Supplier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | Bergamot Essential Oil | 8007-75-8 | Natural (citrus) | Top | 2-8% | $10-15 | Aroma Zone |
| 5 | Lemon Essential Oil | 8008-56-8 | Natural (citrus) | Top | 2-8% | $6-10 | Aroma Zone |
| 6 | Linalool (synthetic) | 78-70-6 | Synthetic (floral-woody) | Top | 1-5% | $6-10 | Creating Perfume |

**Notes on top notes:**
- Citrus essential oils (bergamot, lemon) degrade faster than synthetics. Store in the fridge and use within 6 months of opening.
- Linalool is one of the most versatile aroma chemicals. It appears in lavender, rosewood, and many florals. Use the synthetic version (racemic or specific enantiomer) for consistency.
- Bergamot oil contains bergapten (a phototoxic compound) unless you buy the bergapten-free (FCF) version. For a smell-only device this does not matter, but if you ever apply to skin, buy FCF.

### Heart Notes

The middle of the fragrance. These emerge after the top notes fade and last 1-4 hours.

| # | Ingredient | CAS Number | Category | Note Type | Typical Usage % | Approx. Price (30ml) | Recommended Supplier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Geraniol | 106-24-1 | Synthetic (rose-floral) | Heart | 1-5% | $7-12 | Pell Wall |
| 8 | Hedione (Methyl Dihydrojasmonate) | 24851-98-7 | Synthetic (jasmine-fresh) | Heart | 5-25% | $6-10 | Creating Perfume |
| 9 | Rose Oxide | 16409-43-1 | Synthetic (rose-metallic) | Heart | 0.1-2% | $10-15 | Pell Wall |

**Notes on heart notes:**
- Hedione is a workhorse ingredient in modern perfumery. It adds a transparent, fresh-jasmine quality and blends with almost everything. It is safe to use at high percentages.
- Rose oxide is extremely potent. Use sparingly -- 0.1-0.5% is often enough. A little goes a long way.
- Geraniol is a primary component of rose and geranium oils. Pleasant, versatile, moderate tenacity.

### Base Notes

The foundation of the fragrance. These are the least volatile and can last 4-24+ hours on a blotter strip.

| # | Ingredient | CAS Number | Category | Note Type | Typical Usage % | Approx. Price (30ml) | Recommended Supplier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | Vanillin (synthetic) | 121-33-5 | Synthetic (vanilla-sweet) | Base | 1-10% | $5-8 | Creating Perfume |
| 11 | Iso E Super (Tetramethyl acetyloctahydronaphthalenes) | 54464-57-2 | Synthetic (woody-amber) | Base | 5-30% | $8-14 | Creating Perfume |
| 12 | Ambroxan (Ambrox) | 6790-58-5 | Synthetic (ambergris-woody) | Base | 2-15% | $15-25 | Pell Wall |
| 13 | Cedarwood Essential Oil (Atlas or Virginia) | 8000-27-9 (Atlas) / 8000-27-9 (Virginia) | Natural (woody) | Base | 3-15% | $6-10 | Aroma Zone |
| 14 | Galaxolide (musk) | 1222-05-5 | Synthetic (musk-clean) | Base | 3-15% | $8-14 | Creating Perfume |
| 15 | Patchouli Essential Oil | 8014-09-3 | Natural (earthy-woody) | Base | 2-10% | $8-14 | Aroma Zone |

**Notes on base notes:**
- Vanillin is a solid (crystalline powder) at room temperature. You will need to dissolve it in DPG or ethanol before use. A 10% solution in DPG is standard for working purposes.
- Iso E Super is arguably the single most important synthetic in modern perfumery. It adds a smooth, woody-amber aura. It is the main ingredient in Molecule 01.
- Ambroxan is the synthetic equivalent of ambergris. It is potent, long-lasting, and adds a warm, skin-like quality. It is more expensive than other ingredients but a little goes far.
- Galaxolide is a polycyclic musk. It adds a clean, laundry-like softness. Some people are anosmic (unable to smell) to musks -- this is normal.

### Specialty

| # | Ingredient | CAS Number | Category | Note Type | Typical Usage % | Approx. Price (30ml) | Recommended Supplier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | Calone (methylbenzodioxepinone) | 28940-11-6 | Synthetic (marine-watermelon) | Top-Heart | 0.01-0.5% | $12-18 | Pell Wall |

**Notes on specialty:**
- Calone is what makes things smell "oceanic" or "aquatic." It was the key ingredient in 1990s marine fragrances like L'Eau d'Issey.
- It is extremely powerful. At full concentration, it is overwhelming and unpleasant. Always dilute to 1% or even 0.1% in DPG before using in formulas. The "typical usage %" above refers to the diluted solution's share in the final formula, but the actual amount of pure calone in a blend is often 0.001-0.01%.

## Lab Equipment

These are for Phase 3 (manual formula testing) and remain useful even after you build the hardware.

| Item | Specification | Approx. Price | Where to Buy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Precision scale | 0.01g accuracy, at least 200g capacity. **Recommended: Fuzion Digital Pocket Scale (200g x 0.01g)** or similar. | $20-30 | Amazon | This is the single most important piece of lab equipment. Do not skip it. Do not substitute a kitchen scale (those only read to 1g). |
| Glass graduated pipettes | Set of 1ml, 5ml, and 10ml. Glass, not plastic (some aroma chemicals dissolve plastic). | $10-15 | Amazon | Buy at least 3 of each size so you do not have to wash between every ingredient. |
| Pipette bulbs / fillers | Rubber bulbs that fit the pipettes for drawing liquid. | $5-8 | Amazon | Do not pipette by mouth. |
| Glass beakers | 50ml and 100ml, borosilicate glass. | $8-12 | Amazon | For mixing. Borosilicate is resistant to thermal shock and chemicals. |
| Amber glass bottles (10ml) | Pack of 12-24, with caps (dropper caps or screw caps). | $8-12 | Amazon | For storing finished blends and diluted ingredients. |
| Amber glass bottles (30ml) | Pack of 6-12, with screw caps. | $8-12 | Amazon | For your stock ingredient bottles if the supplier bottles are not amber. |
| Nitrile gloves | Box of 100, disposable. | $8-12 | Amazon / pharmacy | Wear them. Some aroma chemicals are skin sensitizers. Latex is acceptable but nitrile is preferred (fewer allergies). |
| Scent test strips (blotters) | Pack of 100-300. These are the paper strips perfumers use to evaluate scents. | $6-10 | Amazon / Perfumer's Apprentice | Worth buying proper ones. You can substitute heavy card stock or watercolor paper in a pinch, but real blotters work better. |
| Labels | Small adhesive labels or a label maker. | $5-8 | Amazon / office supply | Label everything. Unlabeled bottles are useless within a week. |
| Notebook or spreadsheet | For recording formulas, observations, and scores. | $0-5 | -- | A Google Sheet works fine. |

**Lab equipment total: approximately $80-120.**

## Hardware Components (Phase 4 -- Automated Dispensing)

This is the bill of materials for building the automated dispensing rig.

| Item | Specification | Qty | Approx. Price | Where to Buy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arduino Mega 2560 | Official or clone. Must be Mega (not Uno) -- you need the extra digital pins for 12+ pump channels. | 1 | $15-20 | Amazon / AliExpress | A clone (e.g., Elegoo Mega) works identically and costs less. |
| Peristaltic pumps (12V DC) | 12V dosing pump, ~100ml/min flow rate. **Recommended: Kamoer KFS or generic "12V peristaltic dosing pump" on Amazon/AliExpress.** Look for ones with silicone tubing heads and DC motor. | 12 | $60-100 ($5-8 each) | Amazon / AliExpress | Buy a few spares. Cheap pumps occasionally fail. The Kamoer KFS is a solid mid-range option (~$8 each). Generic ones from AliExpress can be as low as $3-4 each but quality varies. |
| 8-channel MOSFET driver board | IRF540N or D4184-based, 12V compatible. **Recommended: HiLetgo 8-channel MOSFET board** or equivalent. | 2 | $5-8 each ($10-16 total) | Amazon | You need 12 channels total (12 pumps). Two 8-channel boards give you 16 channels with 4 spare. Each channel switches the 12V pump power under control of a 5V Arduino digital pin. |
| 12V 10A switching power supply | Enclosed or open-frame. Must supply 12V DC at 10A or more. | 1 | $12-18 | Amazon | 10A is conservative. Even if all 12 pumps ran simultaneously (unlikely), total draw would be about 6-8A. But headroom is good. Use a proper barrel jack connector or screw terminals -- do not splice wires to a wall adapter. |
| Silicone tubing | Food-grade silicone, **2mm inner diameter (ID) / 4mm outer diameter (OD)** for small pumps, or **3mm ID / 5mm OD** if your pump heads require it. Buy 5 meters to start. | 5m | $8-12 | Amazon | Match the tubing ID to your pump head's tubing channel. Measure before ordering. Silicone is inert and will not react with aroma chemicals. Do not use PVC or latex tubing. |
| Glass mixing vessel | Small glass beaker (50-100ml) or a custom 3D-printed funnel that feeds into a beaker. | 1 | $5-10 | Amazon | All 12 pump outlets converge here. Keep it small so scent concentration stays high. |
| Jumper wires (male-male, male-female) | Assorted pack, at least 40 wires. | 1 pack | $5-8 | Amazon / Adafruit | For connecting Arduino pins to MOSFET boards and any prototyping. |
| Breadboard | Full-size (830 tie points) or half-size. | 1 | $3-5 | Amazon / Adafruit | For prototyping. Once the design is stable, you could solder to perfboard, but a breadboard is fine for a prototype. |
| USB-B cable | Standard USB-A to USB-B cable for Arduino Mega. | 1 | $5-8 | Amazon | Connects the Arduino to your computer for programming and serial communication. |
| 3D printed pump mount frame (optional) | A frame that holds all 12 pumps in a neat row with tubing routed cleanly. | 1 | $0-20 | Self-print or order from a 3D printing service | Not strictly necessary -- you can mount pumps with zip ties on a board. But a printed frame makes the setup much cleaner. Design files may be added to the `hardware/` directory in the future. |

**Hardware total: approximately $125-220.**
